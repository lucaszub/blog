    "raw": "\n## What Is SEO-Friendly Content?\n\nSEO-friendly content is written with the intention of ranking highly in search engine results pages (SERPs). It is optimized for specific target keywords, is easy to read, and provides value to the reader. SEO-friendly content should also engage users, include appropriate meta descriptions and title tags, and fulfill specific search intent.\n\nSearch engines like Google are the key to attracting quality traffic to your website. Most search engines use complex algorithms to crawl the web, indexing content to provide the most relevant pages for users’ queries.\n\nBy optimizing all content for these algorithms, you increase your chances of appearing in organic search results.\n\n### Why Is SEO-Friendly Content Important?\n\nRanking high in search engine results pages is essential for gaining the right type of organic traffic to a website. Since SEO writing focuses on answering the search intent, your content is more likely to impact and influence readers.\n\nA well-optimized blog post or web page not only helps a site rank better but also improves the user experience, encouraging higher browsing times and engagement rates.\n\n## 18 Tips to Write SEO-Friendly Content\n\nWriting SEO-friendly content is more than just including the primary keyword in a meta description. Aim to create engaging and helpful content that solves the reader’s problem. Use the following on-page SEO best practices when writing a blog post.\n\n### 1. Conduct Thorough Keyword Research\n\nEffective SEO writing begins with comprehensive keyword research. This step helps to identify high-traffic keywords and other relevant keywords related to your niche. For this, utilize keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or Semrush.\n\nPay attention to keyword volume and keyword difficulty. You should target keywords that are specific to your niche but aren’t too difficult to rank for.\n\nFor optimal results, don’t just aim for terms with a high search volume – look for keyword suggestions with a lower search volume but high relevance to your niche. It’s also useful to find keyword ideas by browsing competitors’ websites and blogs.\n\nSuppose you’re writing a blog post on “indoor gardening.” After using Google Keyword Planner, you find that related keywords include “best indoor plants,” “indoor gardening tips,” and “how to start an indoor garden.”\n\nConsider creating sub-sections in the blog post that specifically address these related keywords. Offer advice on the best plants for indoor conditions, tips for maintaining them, and steps for starting an indoor garden from scratch.\n\nIt’s also beneficial to use Google Trends to identify seasonal trends around your keywords. For example, “best espresso machines under $200” might have a peak search volume during the holiday season – perfect timing for affiliate promotions.\n",
